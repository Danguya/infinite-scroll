# react-state-management

A look comparing a few different approaches to managing state in react. Mainly this looks at four approaches:
  1. Props
  2. React Context
  3. Redux
  4. Recoil
  
This example holds four files with the different approaches. Two commits will be added, the first will add the props
solution in all files, then the second commit will change the code to use the respective approach.
